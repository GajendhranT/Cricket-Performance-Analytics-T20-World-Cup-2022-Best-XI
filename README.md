**Project Title:
Cricket Performance Analytics â€“ T20 World Cup 2022 Best XI**

**Project Overview:**

This project focused on analyzing player performance data from the T20 World Cup 2022, with the goal of assembling an optimized Best XI team based purely on performance metrics and data-driven insights.
We collected data from ESPNcricinfo, performed extensive data cleaning and transformation, and built a robust Power BI dashboard to visualize and compare players across multiple performance indicators such as batting average, strike rate, bowling economy, wickets taken, and match impact.

**Tools & Technologies Used:**

Python (Pandas): Data scraping, cleaning, transformation
Power Query (Power BI): Additional data shaping and custom columns
DAX (Power BI): Data modeling, dynamic measures, parameter creation
Power BI: Dashboard development and visualization
Excel (supporting): For quick verifications and intermediate calculations

**Key Steps & Responsibilities:**

Data Collection: Scraped match-wise player data (batting, bowling, fielding) from ESPNcricinfo
Data Cleaning & Transformation: Processed raw datasets using Python and Power Query to standardize player stats, handle missing values, and merge datasets
Data Modeling: Used DAX to build calculated columns and measures such as Player Impact Score, Batting Efficiency, and Bowling Pressure Index
Dashboard Design: Created intuitive Power BI dashboards with filters for team, position, role (batsman, bowler, all-rounder), and match conditions
Insight Extraction: Analyzed player stats using visuals to support the selection of an optimal Best XI team

**Outcome:**

Delivered an end-to-end sports analytics solution that mimics real-world selection committees using statistical backing
Demonstrated expertise in data wrangling, modeling, and visualization
Reinforced the value of data-driven decision-making in sports strategy
Practiced real-world BI tool usage in a high-interest domain (cricket)
